# @package _global_
#
# Default experiment wiring for GFlowNet evaluation.
# Dataset should be overridden per experiment (or via CLI).

defaults:
  - override /stage: gflownet_eval

# Checkpoints are run-dependent (not dataset-dependent).
# Keep repo configs environment-agnostic; provide paths via CLI overrides or environment variables.
#
# Recommended:
#   source logs/full_pipeline/<dataset>/<ts>/artifacts.env
# which sets GFLOWNET_CKPT for you. Eval only depends on gflownet ckpt.
ckpt:
  gflownet: ${oc.env:GFLOWNET_CKPT,null}

#
# Debug/tags are controlled by the stage config to avoid duplication.
