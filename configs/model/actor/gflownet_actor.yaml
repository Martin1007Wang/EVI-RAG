# policy_temperature: train-time sampling temperature; <1e-5 degenerates to greedy
# eval_policy_temperature: eval-time temperature; null -> reuse train temperature; set 0 for argmax eval
# stop_logit_bias: bias on stop action; negative discourages early stop
# random_action_prob: epsilon-greedy mixing weight during training; set 0 for eval
# debug_actions: emit per-step action debug logs for first batch
# debug_actions_steps: how many steps to log when debug_actions is true
