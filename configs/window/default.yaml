# Shared window settings for (K, B, φ) analysis.

# Keep this file as the single source of truth for all "window k" lists used by:
# - g_retrieval ranking metrics
# - oracle/truth upper bound evaluation
# - LLM triplet-window evaluation

k_values: [1, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500]

# (max_hops/max_steps are set in experiment configs to avoid coupling).
