# Shared window settings for (K, B, φ) analysis.
#
# Keep this file as the single source of truth for all "window k" lists used by:
# - retriever ranking metrics
# - oracle/truth upper bound evaluation
# - LLM triplet-window evaluation

k_values: [1, 10, 25, 50, 100]

# Rollout budgets for selector evaluation (must be <= eval_gflownet num_eval_rollouts).
rollout_k_values: ${.k_values}

# (max_hops/max_steps are set in experiment configs to avoid coupling).
